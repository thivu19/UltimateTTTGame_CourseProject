This is the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game for my course project. The game start off with an
instruction manual in the beginning of my program, so that if the user is playing 
for the first time they would know what to do. Also, there is an option to either plays 
with an AI or another player. Whenever the user inputs a invalid value it would repeat
the same message asking the user to input a value until it is valid value and would do 
the same for the AI as well.

If I have known earlier that I would have created the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe board differently
from the example that was given. I would have created a more nicer looking and easy to 
the eye board, so that the user would not be overwhelm by the numbers and the word board
while playing the game. And I would also add and replay button that reset the whole board 
again and let the player choose who they are playing either with another player or AI in
the beginning.
